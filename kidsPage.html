              <h5>Pass-word Protection</h5>
            <p style= font-size:60%;>
              A password is like a secret code that you use to protect your online accounts. It’s like a key that unlocks your account and keeps your information safe. You should never share your password with anyone, not even your friends.
<br>
              When you create a password, it’s important to make it strong. A strong password is one that is hard to guess. You can make your password strong by using a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols. For example, you could use a phrase like “I love pizza” and turn it into a password like “1L0v3P!zz@”.</p>

              <p style="font-size:65%;">Just like how you need to brush your teeth to keep yourself healthy, you need an antivirus to help your computer stay healthy. <br>It’s important to have an antivirus installed on your computer and to keep it up to date so that it can protect you from evolving viruses. You could always count on Anti-Virus to protect you from those bad guys.

              <h5>Software Updates</h5>
              <p style="font-size: 65%;">A software update is like a superhero that helps make your computer or phone better. It’s like a magic spell that makes your device faster, stronger, and more powerful.
<br>
                Just like how superheroes need to train and get stronger to fight bad guys, software updates help your device get stronger to fight bugs and other problems. They also add new features and make your device more fun to use.</p>

              <h5>VPNs</h5>
              <p style="font-size: 65%;">When you go on the internet, you leave behind a trail of information that can be used to find out what you’re doing. But when you use a VPN, it hides your trail so that no one can see what you’re doing. It’s like wearing an invisible cloak that makes you invisible to everyone else.
<br>
              VPNs are important because they help keep you safe on the internet. They can help protect you from hackers and other bad guys who want to steal your information. They can also help you get around blocks that might be put in place by your school or parents.</p>

  <p>Use Agent P to your advantage and save your passwords in a secure place. Never share passwords to anyone other than your parents. If you see someone asking for your information to get free in-game currencys or other game items, it's probably a scam.</p>

    <p>Bad guys called hackers create fake programs that look like the tools you use to make your games work better. But when you download these fake programs, they can actually do damage to your computer, like making it slow or taking important information.

    It's important to be a digital defender and be careful and not click on anything that looks strange when you're playing games on the computer. And if you ever see something suspicious, it's a good idea to ask a grown-up for help!</p>
